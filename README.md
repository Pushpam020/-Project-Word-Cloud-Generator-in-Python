# Word Cloud Generator in Python
Word Cloud Generator in Python is a project that demonstrates how to create visual word clouds from a dataset of movie reviews.
A word cloud is a graphical representation of text data where the size of each word reflects its frequency or importance.

## Libraries Used
- pandas → Load and manipulate the dataset
- re → Clean text using regular expressions
- wordcloud → Generate word clouds
- matplotlib.pyplot → Display word cloud plots

## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.8). Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib wordcloud
```
(re is built into Python, no installation required ✅)

## Dataset
This project uses the IMDB Dataset.csv, which contains movie reviews.
```bash
"C:\Users\kumar\Downloads\IMDB Dataset.csv\IMDB Dataset.csv"
```

## Usage
Run the Python script:
```bash
python wordcloud_generator.py
```


## Workflow

-Load Data → Import the IMDB dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Explore Data → Preview column names and sample reviews.
- Combine & Clean Text → Merge all reviews, remove unwanted characters, and convert to lowercase.
- Remove Stopwords → Exclude common English stopwords for better insights.
- Generate Word Cloud → Create word clouds with custom size, colors, and background.
- Display Results → Plot and visualize the word cloud using matplotlib.

## Example Output
Below is an example of the generated word cloud:

## Use Cases
- Text analysis and visualization
- Sentiment analysis of reviews
- NLP & data science reports
- Creative word-based art
